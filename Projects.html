    <h2>Here I'll be linking projects and sites I've done in the past.</h2>

    <p>Just a heads up, some projects aren't the fanciest things because it was still early on in my schooling.</p>
    <p>With that said though, here are some projects I've done so far, other than the portfolio itself, which is also coded in HTML by myself.</p><br>

    <p>-This was a login assignment I did to test my JavaScript skills. It's not the fanciest thing out there but it was one of my first assignments I did learning JS.</p>
    <a href="login.html">Login</a>

    <p>-Here's a site I did for a final in a class of mine. It's a live site as well!</p>
    <a href="https://samkopin.github.io/Web-Design-Final/">Reptiles!</a>

    <p>-STEP RIGHT UP, STEP RIGHT UP, AND TRY YOUR LUCK AT SPACE CASINO!</p>
    <a href="casino.html">Space Casino</a>

    <p>-Here's my original final portfolio I had to do in another class. While I've done one of these before, I desided I didn't like the last one, so why not restart the whole thing?</p>

    <p>While there's not a lot now, I'll continue to add projects as the time goes on.</p>
