    <p>Hello! My name is Sam Kopin. This here is an about me page just to learn a little on who I am.</p>
    <p>As of coding this site I'm in my second semester of college and I'm 19 years young.</p>
    <p>I have a cat named Appa and a ball python named Aphrodite. I love them with all of my heart as they're sweet babies.</p>
    <p>Some hobbies of mine are videogames, art (especially painting), and hanging out with my friends.</p>
    <p>I'm in a few clubs here in school, those clubs are Nerf club, Cooking club, Sword Fighting club, and MTG club. I'm also a EXL lead for the school which means I help new students in orientations and check-ins.</p>
    <p>My favorite things:<br>
        Color- Green, evergreen especially<br>
        Food- Sushi<br>
        Animal- Snakes<br>
        Icecream flavor- chocolate chip cookie dough<br>
    </p>
    <p>I'm the second oldest of 8 kids. I have 4 brothers and 3 sisters. I'm also the first of my siblings to go to college and I'm here to set an example for them.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio website and to read the pages.</p>
