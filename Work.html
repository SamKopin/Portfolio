<p>Skills are always important to have and to keep growing those skills while learning new ones along the way.</p>
<p>Here are some skills I possess in the work industry alone: Food safety certified, communication, team work, leadership, customer service, flexible, hard working, active listener, and can work well under pressure.</p>
<p>While those skills are important, I also have skills towards my degree.</p>
<p>Degree skills up-to-date: Coding in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and C/C++. Works well towards UXD (User Experience Designer)</p>
